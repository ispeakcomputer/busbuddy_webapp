#Bus Buddy Flask App - Arrive On Time

This application pulls the real time data from Denvers RTD transit system. The application finds the arrival times of all the buses on the road. 

This is based on my other application Here. I wrote this one using object-oriented design.

#Motivation

I wanted a more up to date bus arrival times using RTD's predictive data.
